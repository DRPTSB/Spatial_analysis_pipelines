# H&E Analysis Tutorials

## Overview

This section contains tutorials for analyzing **Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)** stained tissue images, a foundational technique in histopathology and spatial biology.

## What is H&E Staining?

H&E staining is the most widely used histological staining method that:
- Highlights tissue architecture and cellular morphology
- Stains nuclei blue (hematoxylin) and cytoplasm/ECM pink (eosin)
- Provides context for spatial omics data
- Enables pathological assessment and annotation

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Staining variability**: Use stain normalization for multi-site studies
2. **Resolution considerations**: Choose appropriate magnification for your analysis
3. **Annotation bias**: Use consensus annotations when possible
4. **Out-of-focus regions**: Implement focus quality checks

## Recommended Tools

- **QuPath**: Open-source digital pathology platform
- **HistomicsTK**: Python toolkit for histopathology analysis
- **Stardist**: Deep learning for cell detection
- **OpenSlide**: Reading whole slide images
- **CLAM**: Weakly-supervised slide classification

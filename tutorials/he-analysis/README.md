# H&E Analysis Tutorials

## Overview

This section contains tutorials for analyzing **Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)** stained tissue images, a foundational technique in histopathology and spatial biology.

## What is H&E Staining?

H&E staining is the most widely used histological staining method that:
- Highlights tissue architecture and cellular morphology
- Stains nuclei blue (hematoxylin) and cytoplasm/ECM pink (eosin)
- Provides context for spatial omics data
- Enables pathological assessment and annotation

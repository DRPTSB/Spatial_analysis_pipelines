# Xenium Spatial Analysis Tutorials

## Overview

This section contains tutorials for analyzing data from **10x Genomics Xenium** platform, which provides in situ spatial transcriptomics at single-cell resolution.

## What is Xenium?

Xenium is a high-plex in situ spatial platform that enables:
- Single-cell resolution spatial transcriptomics
- Detection of hundreds of genes per cell
- Preservation of tissue architecture
- Compatibility with FFPE tissues
